Also creating a histogram for us to see.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN  <- 5000 # Population\nMU <- 100. # Mean of the Population\nstd_dev <- 15 # Standard deviation\n\npopulation <- rnorm(N, mean = MU, sd = std_dev)\n\nhist(population, breaks = 50, main = \"Random Gaussian Distribution\", xlab = \"Value\", col = \"skyblue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we are computing the gini coefficient.

Which is a bit weird since in the simulation of the document Im reading puts the gini coeff at 0.11. Since the error is pretty consistent, I suspect an error in my code. I read through the parameters of the gaussian distribution and saw that the put a small formula into the std_dev part: MU/5.
