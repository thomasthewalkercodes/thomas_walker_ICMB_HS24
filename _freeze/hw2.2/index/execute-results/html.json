So maximum = pot and minimum =-pot for the first value we get. After randomly assigning the first value we get (z) from that rane . We proceed by summing up x and y. This will give us their absolute value of worth. This one minus z should give us the new q.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN  <- 5000 # Population.\nMU <- 0 # Mean of the Population\nstd_dev <- 20 # Standard deviation\n\npopulation <- rnorm(N, mean = MU, sd = std_dev)\nround_population <- round(population)\n\nanyone <- function(round_population){\n  sample(seq_along(round_population), 2)\n}\n```\n:::\n",
