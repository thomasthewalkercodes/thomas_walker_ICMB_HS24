So I made everything overcomplicated whereas I think I should keep the rules of the economy simple: both numbers get added with their absolute difference to 0 (\|x\|). So maximum = pot and minimum =-pot for the first value we get. After randomly assigning the first value we get (z) from that rane . We proceed by summing up x and y. This will give us their absolute value of worth. This one minus z should give us the new q.

```{r}
N  <- 5000 # Population.
MU <- 0 # Mean of the Population
std_dev <- 20 # Standard deviation

population <- rnorm(N, mean = MU, sd = std_dev)
round_population <- round(population)

anyone <- function(round_population){
  sample(seq_along(round_population), 2)
}
```
